# enewscontactbot
A bot used to contact admins of the Telegram channel @enewssg. Made with help from WWH. 

## Usage
1. Go over to [the bot](https://t.me/enewssgbot) and type in the command ```/start```
2. Send any message that you want. 
3. An admin will use the ```/reply``` command and the message will be sent over to you. This can act as a 'support ticket', to help users who have issues

## Credits
